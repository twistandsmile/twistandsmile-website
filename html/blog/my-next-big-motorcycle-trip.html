</div><p>Packing your stuff, throwing it on your motorcycle, and go ride far from home, and only come back weeks
    later…</p><p>Let’s be honest, if you are a rider, whatever the type of motorbike you’re riding, you will be thrilled
    by this first sentence. Every motorcycle rider has either done it already, or really wants to.</p><p>Me, believe it
    or not, I’m in the latest group. All I ever did was day trips, maybe a few week-end trips, but I never really
    <strong>traveled</strong> on my motorcycle. I always wanted, but I never was in a situation where I had money, a
    motorbike I trust, and time, all together.</p><p>At the moment, I have the first two, which in my opinion are the
    hardest to have. Time is an issue, because being a dad of a one-year old daughter doesn’t really comply with going
    away alone for a few weeks. That being said, with the support of my partner, I decided to make the time for it,
    because if I don’t do it now, it may never happen.</p>

</div><h1>🗺️ Where am I going ?</h1><p>Before I tell you the destination, a little bit of context is required.</p><p>As
    you may know, I live in Bulgaria, a country in south-eastern Europe, next to Greece and Turkey. The thing is, I am
    not originally from this country, I only arrived here about 3 years ago. And while I really like living here and
    everything, you can understand that I left a lot of my life in France, where I come from, including friends and
    family.</p><p>That’s where Benoît enters the scene. He is a good friend of mine since many years, and he recently
    got his motorcycle license ! Unfortunately for me, he lives in France, and one day while we were talking about
    motorbikes and stuff, we started joking about going for a ride like tomorrow. And this is at this moment where we
    both realized : <strong>instead of being sorry about the distance separating us, why don’t we use it to our
        advantage ?</strong></p><p>Then, after more talking and planing, the idea was born : <strong>we are going on a
    motorcycle road trip together in September !</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>But how will this work, you both live at the other end of Europe !</em></p></blockquote><p>That’s
    right, and this is what will make it interesting : instead of starting and ending both in the same place, <strong>we
        will actually meet approximately at the half-way point from each other.</strong></p>

</div><p>Yep, we are going to <strong>Slovenia</strong> ! </p><p>Slovenia is a small but diverse country in Central
    Europe, known for its stunning landscapes, going from alpine peaks in the north, to dense forests covering over half
    the country. Lots of lakes, rivers, and of course, mountain passes and small roads !</p><p>Culturally, Slovenia is a
    nice mix of mainly Romance and Slavic influences, reflected in its architecture, food, and traditions.</p><p>It
    couldn’t have been a more suited meeting point ! I’ve been there in the past already, but I’m very happy to go
    again, and explore it on two wheels this time !</p><p>We are planing to spend 4 days together in Slovenia, to
    basically ride all around the country. We will meet around lake Bled, in the north, and start our journey from here.
    The route is 90% planned already, but is subject to changes, so I prefer to talk about it later. And don't worry, I
    will cover this trip on this Substack, so if you’re interested, don’t forget to subscribe !</p><p

</div><h1>🛣️ To Slovenia and back !</h1><p>Obviously, going somewhere means there is a journey to this place, and you
    also have to come back home at some point !</p><p>Most people only focus on their destination when they travel,
    which is understandable when you take the plane for example. One of the advantages of motorcycle traveling is that
    the journey to your destination becomes an integral part of the whole vacation.</p><p>I could have chosen to take
    the plane and rent a motorcycle over there, but that was not the spirit. We both planned our journey to Slovenia on
    our own, and we're honestly just as excited about the way to there and back as we are about the adventure in
    Slovenia itself !</p><p>The direct way for me would be to go through Serbia and Croatia, but I have chosen to pass
    through Romania and Hungary, mainly for 2 reasons :</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>I have never been in those countries, so I figured that was an opportunity to at least get a glance, and come
        back another time for a deeper exploration if the first impressions are good</p></li>
    <li><p>Serbia is not part of the European Union, nor even the Schengen Area, which makes the border crossing a bit
        annoying, and my phone won’t work there unless I buy a local SIM card</p></li>
</ul><p>So I’ve chosen the longer way, but because I will not be in a hurry, this turns out to be the more convenient
    way as well. Also, I don’t plan on taking any highways, this trip will be entirely on small roads !</p><p>Masochist
    you say ? Well, maybe, but that’s the way I like to ride, and highways give me absolutely zero pleasure. I’m sitting
    on my motorbike to enjoy, not to eat as much kilometers as fast as possible.</p><p>For my way back, I'm still not
    sure. Part of me wants to go through Bosnia, Montenegro, Albania, North Macedonia, etc. Because I've always been
    attracted to those somewhat “less popular” countries, and I definitely want to discover them. But on the other hand,
    this will lengthen the trip a lot, and as I mentioned earlier, I have a wife and kid waiting for me at home so maybe
    it will be for another time. We will see !</p>

</div><p>Now that you know what's coming, I have a request for you : do you have any recommendations on things to see or
    do in Slovenia or any of the countries I'll pass through ? We already have a list, but we will greatly appreciate
    any suggestions. Don't hesitate to comment and if we find your idea interesting, we will make sure to include it in
    our schedule !</p>

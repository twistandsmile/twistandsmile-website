        <p><a href="i-defied-the-trend-and-went-back.html">In my previous post</a>, I walked you through my motorcycle progression, and ultimately told you that I opted for a “beginner” model for my most recent purchase, even though I am an experienced rider. But why is that ?</p>
        <p>In this post, I’m going to tell you <strong>6 advantages I find about riding a simple, not so powerful motorcycle</strong>, that convinced me that I was done with big motorbikes (well, at least for now !).</p>
        <p>Just to clarify, I’m calling “big motorbikes” those that make around 100 HP or above. </p>
        <p>⚠️ <strong>Little disclaimer</strong> : what will follow is only my subjective opinion. I am not trying to say that this is the absolute truth and you have to follow it. In short, to each their own, don’t follow blindly what a random guy on the internet is saying, do what makes you happy !</p>

        <hr>

        <h1>💰 Price</h1>
        <p>This is the obvious one, and unless you have a magic money printer at home, you cannot deny the fact that paying less is a big advantage.</p>
        <p>Big motorbikes are expensive. If you want one of the big boys <em>(BMW GS, KTM 1290, Yamaha R1, you name it)</em>, it will cost you at least 15.000€, if not closer or even above 20.000€ after adding some options and accessories. You can already save half of that price by going with a 500cc or 600cc equivalent.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>Yeah sure, but I’m buying my motorbikes second hand anyway, so for the price of your 500cc, I can have a used 1200cc !</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Of course, but so far we only talked about the money you’ll have to spend just to <strong>possess</strong> the motorbike. To this, you’ll have to add the price of registration, insurance, maintenance, and if you have a “premium” motorcycle, <strong>even used</strong>, the cost of all of this can climb up <strong>very fast</strong> and <strong>very high</strong>. It’s also worth mentioning the higher fuel consumption, as well as the consumables - <em>especially the expensive tires</em> - that will wear quicker on a heavy, powerful motorbike.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>It’s fine, I can afford all of this !</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p>And also afford to travel with it ? If yes, the cost of motorcycling is obviously not a problem at all for you, and this is awesome !</p>
        <p>If not, picture this, would you prefer to :</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Have a shiny big motorbike full of features, and only being able to afford to drive it in your backyard ?</p></li>
            <li><p>Have a smaller, less sexy motorbike, and use the remaining cash to right away go explore your country, your continent, or even the world with it ?</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Yes I know, I’m exaggerating a little bit, but still… Think about it ! </p>
        <p>Of course the motorcycle industry with its huge marketing force will tell you that you <strong>need</strong> a big motorbike to travel the world, but the reality is that this is very far from the truth, as we will see going forward in this article.</p>

        <h1>💪 Enough power</h1>

        <p>If you live in Europe - <em>or in Australia, I know it is similar out there -</em> you should be familiar with the motorcycle license system : when you finally decide that it is time for you to get your ass on a motorcycle and you go pass your license, you will end up with the “A2” license, which limits you to models that make about 48 HP or less. You will have to go through this for at least 2 years, no matter what, before you can decide to unlock the full “A” license and be able to ride whatever you want.</p>
        <p>Have you ever wondered, why this number ? Why has the limit been set to just under 50 HP, and not somewhere else ?</p>
        <p>The answer is simple : <strong>you can do absolutely everything </strong>with this kind of power, and even without frustration ! I know that this is a controversial topic, so let me try to explain in multiple points :</p>

        <h4>🚫 Speed limits</h4>

        <p>Yes I know, this one may sound lame for you, but this is a reality. In our current society where road freedom basically doesn’t exist anymore, and repression being an all-time high, I don’t see the point of absurdly powerful vehicles on the road. You just cannot use them properly, one twist of the throttle and you are already flying way above the speed limit without even realizing.</p>
        <p>I’m not saying that you are not able to break the speed limit with a small motorbike, you can, but to a lesser extend and without sacrificing the fun of having a light vehicle, pouncing in the twisties. This is where they shine, they are nervous and capable enough to give you an enjoyable kick in the butt (and you don’t have to be a masochist to understand that) at legal speeds. Of course they struggle regarding raw top speed, but in my opinion, it is a great advantage to be able to enjoy your ride without compromising your license. I’ll give you some numbers from my Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 - <em>40 HP, 200 kg</em> - and you will understand :</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>From 0 to 100 km/h (0-60 mph) : about 7 seconds</p></li>
            <li><p>From 100 to 130 km/h (60-80 mph) : about 6 seconds</p></li>
            <li><p>From 130 to 150 km/h (80-95 mph) : about 8 seconds</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>I think those numbers speak for themselves : the fun is bellow the speed limit, not above it.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>Yes I understand, but I always respect the speed limit with my 100+ HP motorbike !</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Then why bother ? You simply don’t need that power. With my motorbike I already reach 100 km/h faster than 90% of the cars, and I don’t even have one of the most powerful models a beginner can get !</p>

        <h4>🦺 Safety</h4>

        <p>Let’s face it : motorcycling <strong>is</strong> dangerous, and it is explained by basic physics : when you ride, you only have 2 points of contact on the ground at all time, which means that you and your motorbike are constantly fighting against gravity that is pulling you towards the ground.</p>
        <p>For obvious reasons, a very powerful motorcycle will be more dangerous. A small engine is more manageable, more forgiving, with a lot more room for mistakes, and trust me, you will make mistakes, there is no way around it. The thing is, while a mild mistake can be easily compensated and corrected on a small motorbike, it will take more skills and effort to fix the same mistake on a powerful motorcycle.</p>

        <h4>🎉 Fun factor</h4>

        <p>As I previously mentioned in my previous post, there is something special about pushing and exploiting a not so powerful motorcycle. Sure it won’t be the fastest on the highway, as talked earlier, but anyone can go fast in a straight line on perfect asphalt, and let’s be honest, highways are not enjoyable whatever the model you are sitting on. The vast majority of riders will prefer to use secondary roads, where the scenery, the turns and the lowest density of traffic make the ride way more enjoyable.</p>
        <p>And this is where things get interesting, especially noticeable when you ride in group : with your 400cc, you will definitely be able to follow and keep up with the big motorbikes, and you know why ? Because - <em>unless your name is Marc Marquez and you are blowing away the speed limit</em> - you cannot use a 100+ HP motorcycle on a secondary road to its full potential, the power effectively usable will be around or even bellow the capacities of your small engine. And let me tell you : <strong>it is way more fun to push a small motorbike to its full potential rather than holding back on a 1000cc</strong>.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>Sure, but what about if I’m going on track ? I need power there !</em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>On track - <em>or off-road, it is similar in that regard </em>- the most important thing to have is <strong>skills</strong>. So, if you are not a very advanced pilot, you still have a lot to learn on a small motorbike, and you will even learn more effectively. Trust me, I have seen people - <em>and even KIDS </em>- on 125cc, 250cc and 300cc absolutely <strong>crushing</strong> guys on modern 1000cc sport motorbikes on track. The power difference will save a bit of your ego in the big straight portions, but as discussed earlier, anyone can go full throttle in a straight line, but if you don’t have the skills needed to use that power, you wont be able to keep up in the turns.</p>

        <h1>🧘 Less worry</h1>

        <p>To put it simply, with a small motorbike, you are not afraid of it. This fear could come from different reasons : fear of the power, the anxiety of dropping and damaging your precious, the constant worry of it not being stolen, you name it. With a simple small motorbike, those factors are greatly minimized, which allow you to relax and even be adventurous.</p>
        <p>To help you picture it, let’s talk about my experience : I owned an Aprilia SL1000 Falco for almost 5 years. A sport motorbike, with the same sporty V-twin from the RSV 1000 that delivers 120 HP. I was used to go on track, as I went several times with my 2 previous motorbikes. You would guess that I rode on track with the Aprilia, right ? I mean, it’s perfect for it, it was designed for that ! Well, no, I didn’t go a single time, because I was terrified !</p>

        <div class="captioned-image-container">
            <img src="/img/blog/reasons-why-you-dont-need-a-big/on-track.jpg">
            <small class="image-caption">Yep, that’s me ! Well, young me, on my VFR 750.</small>
        </div>

        <p>On the other way around, now with my Himalayan 450, I see myself becoming way more adventurous and daring. Of course I’m not going on track with it, this motorbike has nothing to do there, but the other day I came across a “shortcut”. This shortcut was actually an off-road track through the forest, used by 4x4 to reach quickly the village next by. I looked at it, and without any second thoughts, I told myself “alright let’s do it”, and I went there. I never rode off-road in my life before, so this was challenging, but man, the fun I had, and I wasn’t worried at all. This small motorbike gives me confidence, and if ever I drop it, well, it’s alright, I wouldn’t mind that much. If I was riding a big GS for example, I would definitely not say that, and I probably wouldn’t have taken this trail.</p>

        <div class="captioned-image-container">

            <small class="image-caption">This portion doesn’t look intimidating, but I assure you that there was some tricky terrain back there in the forest.</small>
        </div>

        <p>An other important aspect, is that a simple motorcycle reconnects you to the essence of riding : two wheels, an engine, and off you go. It’s hard to be simpler than that and in my opinion, simplicity is a big added value that isn’t there anymore on powerful motorbikes.</p>
        <p>Those big engines will most of the time come with tons of electronics, settings, riding modes, and so on. Ironically, all of those added stuff are there to try and make the power more manageable so that you don’t crash in the first tree. You don’t believe me ? Go and try a 200 HP sport motorbike without any electronic assistance, and we will see if your underwear are still clean after 15 minutes !</p>
        <p>So yeah, a simple, user-friendly motorbike, doesn’t need all those gadgets, you just sit on it and enjoy your ride, instead of wondering if you have set your assistance correctly and if you are in the correct “mode”. So many things not to worry about, that allow you to fully enjoy your ride.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>But if you buy an old sport motorbike, you don’t have all of this stuff anyway so it’s also worry-free !</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Well, here comes a different kind of worry : you have to do the job of the electronic assistance yourself.</p>
        <p>On my Aprilia, I had no electronics whatsoever, not even the nowadays mandatory ABS ! Don’t get me wrong, this was a fantastic motorbike, <strong>BUT</strong> - <em>and this is a big but</em> - when you ride this, you have to be prepared for it. Each ride is a constant fight between the rider and the motorbike, you need the willpower to be able to stay reasonable, because the motorbike will push you to do mistakes if you are not concentrated.</p>
        <p>If you didn’t know, those old powerful motorbikes when they first appeared in the 70s-80s, they were so uncontrollable and dangerous that people nicknamed them “widow makers”, and for a reason.</p>

        <h1>🔧 Reliability and fixability</h1>

        <p>This is also an important aspect. When your motorcycle works great, you may not be aware of this, but in case of a problem, having a simple machine is a big plus.</p>
        <p>Imagine that you are traveling far from home, even in another country that you don't know much about, and your motorbike start to behave weird. If you are not a mechanic - <em>like probably most of riders</em> - you'll need assistance. With a simple motorbike, almost any professional can look at it and fix it quite quickly for not so much money, allowing you to continue your trip in peace. But let's say you have a high end motorcycle, with complex electronics or from some exotic not so broadly distributed brand, not every mechanic would be able to fix it, and some will refuse to even look at it. You also may need to replace some very specific parts or components, that can take a long time to order and arrive there, leaving you no choice but to wait. I know some people that had problems during a trip to the Middle East with a big Suzuki V-Strom. They had to wait around for a week until the spare parts arrived, taking a lot of time off their adventure.</p>
        <p>Here the simple motorbikes have the edge, they usually don't need special tools to be worked on and can be easily fixed in case of a problem, because the possible causes are not so many, which greatly facilitate the diagnosis part.</p>

        <div class="captioned-image-container">
            <img src="/img/blog/reasons-why-you-dont-need-a-big/tools.jpg">
            <small class="image-caption">Photo by Tekton</small>
        </div>

        <p>Most of the time, problems don't come from the engine itself. Nowadays, those are strong and reliable. When a problem occurs, the cause is usually from the peripherals, electronics, added electrical accessories and so on. In the best case, only the faulty component stops working, not affecting the rest of the motorbike, and this is alright. But sometimes, a faulty part can shut down the entire motorbike, leaving you stranded.</p>
        <p>So my advice would be, especially if you are traveling : <strong>choose a simple, reliable model, from a known brand that have a good network</strong> around where you plan to go. As said, firstly you limit the risks of having a problem by having a simple designed motorbike, and secondly if ever you face a problem, you are never very far from someone who can work on it. You can even work on it yourself if you have basic tools with you and some knowledge.</p>

        <h1>🪶 Weight</h1>

        <p>On a trip, weight <strong>always matter</strong>. The lighter you are, the better the overall experience of riding will be. When you have a big and powerful travel motorbike, it’s usually heavy by itself, and you are also tempted to pack it with a lot of luggage.</p>

        <div class="captioned-image-container">
            <img src="/img/blog/reasons-why-you-dont-need-a-big/heavy.jpg">
            <small class="image-caption">Photo by Zakaria Zayane</small>
        </div>

        <p>Top metal box, hard panniers, saddle bags, full with a lot of stuff. All of this is adding so much weight to your already heavy machine, and the riding and comfort will be affected. On perfect straight roads with perfect asphalt it is not a big deal, but when you eventually go on smaller roads with questionable quality, you will start to regret. You can also most definitely say goodbye to the eventuality of going off-road, which would be way too hard with such a heavy motorcycle to control, and to pick-up if ever you fall.</p>

        <div class="captioned-image-container">
            <img src="/img/blog/reasons-why-you-dont-need-a-big/soft-luggage.jpg">
            <small class="image-caption">Photo by LouisMoto</small>
        </div>

        <p>With a small travel motorbike, first it’s lighter by itself, and also you tend to limit the luggage you are putting on it. Mainly because you don’t want to overload the engine too much, and also because you simply don’t have a lot of space. Usually with this kind of motorcycle you will make the choice of soft luggage, which are lighter than the big metal boxes - <em>by the way, those require some extra metal frame on your motorbike as well to be mounted</em> - and also arguably more compact. You will then sort your things, and take with you only the essentials, which will make your journey lighter and more enjoyable.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>Sure, but I’m going for a month trip, I need a lot of stuff !</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p>That’s where people kind of panic, and tend to pack extra stuff “<strong>just in case”</strong>.</p>
        <p>In fact, you absolutely don’t need more stuff. The things you need for a 5 days trip will be the same as for a 2 weeks trip, and for a 3 months trip. The extra you are willing to take are only there because you’re afraid of missing something.</p>
        <p>I always make the parallel with hiking. When I first started multi-days hiking, I had a huge backpack, very heavy, full of things. This made the journey hard, and took away a lot of the enjoyment that I could have had. And the irony is, when I came back home, I realized that a lot of the stuff I was carrying around was never used once ! That’s when I understood the famous saying : “<em>a big backpack is full of anxiety</em>”. From there, I started reducing more and more, learning from previous hikes and not taking the things I didn’t use, and my pleasure on the trails became greater and greater the lighter my backpack was becoming.</p>
        <p>This is the same on two wheels. Even if you are not physically carrying your stuff on your body, you have no idea how good it feels to travel light, and if you know, you understand what I’m talking about and why I encourage people to try it. You’ll never go back !</p>

        <hr>

        <h1>👥 Blend in</h1>

        <p>I could have put this one in the “less worry” paragraph, but I think it deserves a special mention. When you travel, especially abroad, you want to avoid attracting too much attention. This is especially true if you plan to go to a poorer country and/or in a country with a motorcycle culture that is not very developed or different from what we know. If you ride a simple motorbike, hardly anybody will notice you, you’ll be able to blend in amongst the locals and don’t attract unwanted attention.</p>

        <div class="captioned-image-container">
            <img src="/img/blog/reasons-why-you-dont-need-a-big/blend.jpg">
            <small class="image-caption">Would you rather park here with a BMW GS 1300, or with a Yamaha XT 600 ? Photo by Nico Smit</small>
        </div>

        <p>What do you think will happen when you show up with your big expensive motorcycle, displaying a foreign license plate, packed like a mule with shiny metal boxes ? You will look like an UFO, and a target for opportunists. I’m not saying something bad will necessarily happen, but you will think about it, and this uncomfortable feeling will spoil the moment. You will then search to chase away this feeling by only stopping in secure areas and sleep in hotels with closed parking, which not only will cost you more time and money - <em>remember the first point in this article ?</em> - but will also make you miss the opportunity to visit some less touristy places. I would definitely rather choose to worry-free be able to wander around, go with the flow and immerse myself in the local population and culture, which, in my opinion, is why you should be traveling abroad in the first place.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>But of course, it all depends on your priorities, and as I said at the beginning of this article, I’m not here to tell you what to do. those are only my personal views, and I would love to know about yours. So, tell me what you think in the comments !</p>

        <p>As you may or may not know, there is a very defined trend - <em>at least in Europe </em>- about what bike you should ride. For starters, when you freshly got your licence, it’s commonly suggested to go on a middle sized engine, let’s say around 500-600cc. But the thing is, every time you feel like changing, everything is made for you to <strong>want more</strong>.</p>
        <p>And it’s logical, right ? People collectively believe that more power means more fun, and that’s why you want to change your bike in the first place ! Even when you go to dealerships, they will always ask you what you are currently riding, and they will always direct you towards bigger, more powerful models.</p>
        <p>And me, being a clueless young rider, I believed in that as well. </p>

        <hr/>

        <p>Before talking about my current situation, let me tell you about my motorcycle progression :</p>
        
        <div class="captioned-image-container">

        <p>My first bike was a Kawasaki ER-6N from 2006 (or Ninja 650 in the USA). I was very happy, I traveled a lot with it, I didn’t even have my car licence at the time so I was doing everything with my trusty “beginer” bike. I even went on track with it !</p>
        <p>But of course, after 50.000 km on it, I wanted more. that’s when I bought a used Honda VFR 750 from 1997 :</p>

        <div class="captioned-image-container">
            <img src="/img/blog/i-defied-the-trend-and-went-back/vfr.jpg">
        </div>

        <p><strong>Bigger ! Sportier ! More power !</strong> Am I doing this right, folks ?!</p>
        <p>I was delighted, this may not have been the sexiest one out there, but it was the perfect bike for me at the time. And I was right, because to this day, I can confidently say that this was the best bike I ever owned. And I would probably still have it, if I didn’t have a big accident with it on my way to work. A car crossed my path in front of me, and it was impossible to dodge or stop in time. I violently crashed into it, flew over the roof, and smashed down on the ground. Luckily - <em>and also thanks to my full equipment which I always wear</em> - I didn’t have any injuries, but my beloved VFR was completely wrecked (as well as the dude’s car by the way).</p>
        <p>So a few weeks later, what did I do ? You guessed it !</p>

        <div class="captioned-image-container">
            <img src="/img/blog/i-defied-the-trend-and-went-back/falco.jpg">
        </div>

        <p><strong>Bigger ! Sportier ! More power !</strong> I got myself a used Aprilia SL 1000 Falco from 2002.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>Hold on a minute, didn’t you just say that the VFR was perfect for you ? Why didn’t you got another one ?</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Simply because I was unconsciously biased by the global trend I told you in the beggining. I was getting a new bike, so I <strong>had</strong> to get bigger !</p>
        <p>And to be fair, this bike was awesome as well, but in a different way. The Honda was tamed, easy, forgiving and reliable, while this one was the total opposite. Every ride was like a fight between me and her. Maybe to you it sounds terrible, but for me at this time, I absolutely loved it. I went everywhere with it and put a lot of kilometers on the odometer. But ultimately came the time when I had to sell it, because I was moving to live in another country and it would have been too difficult and expensive to take it with me.</p>

        <hr/>

        <p>Two years passed, and at this point, the itch became too strong : I had to get a bike. So my searches began, and at first I was naturally looking at big bikes, like the BMW R1200R, that sort of things.</p>
        <p>But then after a lot of researches and reflexion, I couldn’t find anything that made me say “that’s what I want !”. So I said to myself : “You know what ? Screw the trend, I’ll give a chance to the small ones as well !”</p>
        <p>And that’s how I came across my current bike :</p>

        <div class="captioned-image-container">
            <img src="/img/blog/i-defied-the-trend-and-went-back/himy.jpg">
        </div>

        <p><strong>Bigger ? Sportier ? More power ?</strong>… Well, not at all, this is a Royal Enfield Himalayan 450, a single cylinder delivering a jaw-dropping 40 HP !</p>
        <p>If you noticed, this is the least powerful motorbike I ever owned ! And I can tell you this : having a raging beast between your legs is fun and all, but <strong>there is something special about driving a small bike fast</strong>. With the Aprilia, there was no way I could use it to 100% on the open road, not a chance ! With this one, I still can’t because I’m not a pilot, but I can tackle the limits a little bit if I go very hard, and believe me, this is a great feeling that you cannot have with a 100+ HP bike.</p>
        <p>There is a very popular saying, at least in France where I come from, that says :</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>If you ever ride a 1000cc, you’ll not be able to go back !</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Well, I’ve done it, and I would do it again if I could !</p>
        <p>I’ll very soon write another post to explain the reasons why I “downgraded”, and the advantages I found to riding a simple, not so powerful bike. So stay tuned !</p>
